        Marissa Treece has been training dogs professionally since 2012. Her
        love of dog training all started from childhood where she trained her
        family dog a variety of tricks, including sliding down slides, playing
        dead, and wiping her eyes on cue. As an adult, Marissa started out her
        career in the animal field by socializing puppies and then expanded into
        formal training, animal husbandry, puppy photographer, and more. She
        decided to further her education on the Dog Training Field by studying
        through CATCH Canine Trainers Academy where she completed the Master's
        Course with an over all grade of 90% in 2017, receiving high regards
        from both her program adviser and her mentor trainer. Marissa is a firm
        believer in positive reinforcement training and making the training
        process fun for both the dog and the owner and her goal is to improve
        the lives of dogs and their owners within the community. Marissa and her
        husband have 5 furry children--Alli the brindle Border Collie mix
        (2009), Murdock the Coonhound Border Collie mix disguised as a Black Lab
        look-a-like (2010), Sampson the Shepherd mix (2011), Portia the red
        Australian Labradoodle (2012), and Winnie the cream Australian
        Labradoodle and daughter of Portia (2015). Marissa's husband is also the
        official dog snuggler!
