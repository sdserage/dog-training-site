        Our Train-to-Adopt program was established to help dogs from a variety
        of backgrounds become more adoptable. The primary focus of this program
        is to help dogs become better socialized and to give them a head start
        on their training before going to their new home. Each dog is evaluated
        in a variety of situations to figure out the best type of home they
        should be adopted into for both the dog and their forever family. To
        adopt one of our dogs,
